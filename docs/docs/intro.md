# Introduction

:::warning

⚠️ Torii is in active development and not ready for production yet. Contributions appreciated.

:::

Torii is a simple, powerful and extensible open-source Internal Developer Portal where developers can find all the tools and
services they need to build, deploy, and manage their applications.

Torii focus on three principles:

- **Easily configurable**: Platform Engineers can easily define a catalog of tools and services available to developers. They can also
  define a scorecard and a workflow for each tool and service.
- **Easily usable**: Developers can easily find and use the tools and services they need to build, deploy, and manage their applications via
  a simple web interface.
- **Easily extensible**: Platform Engineers can easily extend Torii by adding new tools and services to the catalog.

That's it!
